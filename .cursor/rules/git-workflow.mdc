Git workflow:

* For new sections (feature/fix/bug): first update `main`. If thereâ€™s no change in `main`, check whether the MR has been merged. Always create a new branch.
* After completing a section: commit, push, and always create an MR.
* Never push to the `main` branch (consider protecting `main`).
* Always have Cursor create the MR.
* Commit and MR messages must always be short and precise.
* For commit and MR message never use emojis, icons, graphics - never more than 5-10 lines.
* Use only ASCII characters in Git messages and MR descriptions
